       <p> My first project was completed during the summer as a result of Mr. Kaiser's summer homework. Because of my lack of previous coding skills, I made project 9 ( a culmination of the skills we learned during the homework), pretty simple. I focused on implementing variables, multiple different sprites, and different backdrops. The last part of my story focused on using a mouse tracker to follow a bear as he chases a ball around. It was a fairly simple project but it represents my growth in my ability to code.

       <p> For my polygon generator I worked with a partner. Together, we designed a code that would create any regular polygon we wanted. This was scaled based on the interior angle and number of sides needed for our polygon. In addition, we created the code necessary to make different shapes such as a star and even a circle. This project represented my ability to think and improvise new strategies when faced with problems.

       <p>  For my last project, I am including my genius hour. For my genius hour I am working on the STEAM Outreach program. In this project, our goal is to recreate and design a buildable solar paneled car. Specifically, I am in control of managing the creation of other parts in the car, crimping wires and the design of the wood base. This project represents my creative talent and is challenging my ability to adapt to new problems.
